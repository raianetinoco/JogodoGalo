 # JogodoGalo

The program allows two players to choose X or O to compete who wins with the moves. 

Whoever makes the sequence three times in a row wins. At the end of each match it is shown who was the winner or if it was a tie. 

The program allows saving names and viewing the ranking list of players.

To run JogodoGalo you need to import the bd_jogogalo.sql into a SQL tool. I used XAMPP PHPMyAdmin.

For the construction of this program, different languages were used: JavaScript, HTML, CSS, PHP, and SQL database.

Program developed as a final project of the Programming course.
